  - redo Memory Puzzle and Sudoku and compare your solution with given solutions, your current implementation was good but you need to practice and get better faster at it

  - Ruby > Recursion  
	this whole section has to be revisited and redone, the presenter was anojing and the projects where hard, exercise was so so, bonus was easy, but word chains was hard to understand what needs to be done, you don't need to redo HTML project, take a look at it though

```
Revisit at some point

Ruby > References
	> Method Decomposition & Design - very good lesson
